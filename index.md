## About

My interest and experience focus on data, from raw to structured, from analytics to insights and inference. I like working on data infra, pipeline and statistical data science, and utilize them to solve practical problems in advertising, search, etc.

I got my Master in Computer Science from Cornell in 05/2017. Prior to that, my academic background was from Peking University in China. I also interned at Alibaba and Didi Chuxing before I came to the United States.
