## About

I love data related challenges including data infrastructure and data science. I enjoy utilizing computer system and machine learning techniques to solve these technical challenges in the real world. I had two software engineer internships respectively at Alibaba and Didi Chuxing.

I will get my Master in Computer Science degree from Cornell in 05/2017. Before that, my academic background was from Peking University in China.
